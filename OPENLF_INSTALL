# copy files #####################
untar contents of archive into buildroot directory
merge if asked to. Check contents of board, config
and package to insure the files went in the correct
locations.



# Config.in ######################
open the file
package/Config.in

scroll to the very bottom, and paste this block before the last line
which should be an "endmenu"

menu "OpenLF Packages"
source "package/lfd/Config.in"
endmenu



# build ###########################
set defconfig to use and build
$ make openlf_didj_defconfig
$ make menuconfig
	Package Selection for the target  --->
	OpenLF Packages --->
	select lfd
$ make

This will create a rootfs
output/images/rootfs.ubi
output/images/rootfs.tar
output/target/<rootfs>


to customize packages
$ make menuconfig
	Package Selection for the target  --->

$ make busybox-menuconfig


# Issue ###########################
If busybox or uclibc menuconfig doesn't work
run 'make source' first

buildroot can't remove packages, so if you must
$ make clean
and build it over again.

If adding packages that create files you need to modify
look at the board/OpenLF/Didj/open_didj_post.sh script
this is run before creating the images. Use it to clean
up unwanted files, add files, modify etc.
